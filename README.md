Project with my partner of the course: Simulation of rare events
This project describes the evolution of a population where each individual lives a random time distributed according to an exponential law of parameter λ (independently of the other individuals), and dies giving birth to two individuals. So we note that Yt the of individuals present at time t and the process (Yt)t≥0 is called the Yule process of parameter λ .

Using the five properties related to the Yule process given in the toolkit, this project simulates some small probability events using methods such as probability change, selection and mutation, using what we have learned in this semester's modality course.

Then, the theory of Yule processes was applied to one and two dimensional space, simulating the birth and development of predators and prey, which allowed us to better understand theories such as the Poisson process and the random walk
